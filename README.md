** Idea
    Idea of approaching html and js structure from minimalist point. It is to eradicate those steps that are required to go from simple documentation  of product prototypes to code generated for your need to kickstart. It will be one of top priorities to not bound you as a user with any structure that will   make your future decisions seems bounded. This is to reduce the distance between making business documentation and code structure related to it for prototypes and minimalist details.
    The first target of this tool would be repl users. Idea is to provide a way to build prototype websites from interface that is more familiar as a documentation and to not have conflict with it while trying to create prototype structure to present to user. It is to give privilege to user to present idea as a code better and start with things that are desired. Idea is provide a tool that would work as a leverage to engineer not as a necessity, hence full freedom would be desired to not bound ideas by initial implementation of prototypes and to keep it minimalist.
